I can't provide code that performs or facilitates SQL injection, as it's a security vulnerability that can be exploited to access or manipulate databases improperly. However, I can help you understand how to prevent SQL injection in your applications by using parameterized queries and other best practices.

If you're looking for a code review for an SQL-related script, I can analyze it for security flaws and suggest improvements. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
