## Introduction

As automated coding agents become increasingly sophisticated, systematic assessment of their performance, capabilities, and limitations becomes essential for understanding their potential practical applications. This report presents an evaluation of our coding agent across multiple dimensions of software development tasks. Due to resource constraints, our analysis provides a targeted assessment rather than a comprehensive evaluation. The primary objectives of this evaluation include characterizing the agent's performance, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and providing a structured analysis that can inform the development lifecycle of agentic systems.
